#### Description:
Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a dynamic and interactive website where users can play TicTacToe either against a computer with three different difficulty levels or against another local player. The application will be built using a combination of Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL to provide a seamless user experience with persistent data tracking for user statistics.

Technologies Used:
Python: Backend logic, user authentication, game state management, and interaction with the SQL database.
JavaScript: Frontend functionality, dynamic content updates (such as updating the scores), and handling user interactions on the web pages' game grid and buttons.
HTML: Structure of the web pages, including the game grid and login/registration forms.
CSS: Styling the web pages.
SQL: Database management for storing user data in two tables, one for username and password, the other for game statistics.

FEATURES:
Game Modes:

Single Player vs. AI:
Users can play against the computer in three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, each modifying the AI's behavior and strategy.

Local Multiplayer:
Two users can play against each other on the same device. The interface includes an indicator to mark the current player's turn.


User Authentication:

Registration:
New users can create an account by providing a username and password, and user data is stored securely in the SQL database.
Login:
Returning users can log in to access their game statistics and continue playing.


Statistics Tracking:

Personalized Statistics:
Wins, losses, ties, and win ratios are tracked for each user. Statistics are categorized based on the difficulty level of AI and local multiplayer games.
